# Objectives
Week 1: Interpret the effects of linear transformations on means and (co)variances. Compute means/variances of linearly transformed data sets. Write code that represents images as vectors and computes basic statistics of datasets.

Week 2: Introduce and practice the concept of an inner product, which will allow us to talk about geometric concepts in vector spaces. More specifically, we will start with the dot product, as a special case of an inner product, and then move toward a more general concept of an inner product, which play an integral part in some areas of machine learning, such as kernel machines (this includes support vector machines and Gaussian processes).

Week 3: Look at orthogonal projections of vectors, which live in a high-dimensional vector space, onto lower-dimensional subspaces. This will play an important role in the next module when we derive PCA.

Week 4: Think of dimensionality reduction as a way of compressing data with some loss, similar to jpg or mp3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is one of the most fundamental dimensionality reduction techniques that are used in machine learning.
